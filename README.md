Combine the drop.sql with the create.sql

Then add in queries.sql and storedProcedures.sql

Note: 
 -When running stored procedures in Oracle, run the procedures including 'set serveroutput on;'
 -Make sure to exclude the EXEC statement when running procedures, it will not execute properly, then
 -Comment out or remove procedures once they have ran without EXEC statements
 -Add in EXEC statements for procedures and run them to see output
